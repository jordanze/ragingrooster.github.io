title: Malware Monster Manual
---

Let’s face it if you want to be a malware analyst, then you’re going to have to embrace nerd culture. This article is my attempt to pay homage to D&D and to describe the monstrosities analysts may encounter on their adventure to level 20… oops, I mean to becoming reverse engineers... right?

In my last article I gave a brief overview of the different types of malware analysis and the people who perform this noble task. But, that probably left you wondering about the types of malware that are out there in the wild. It is imperative that analysts know how to identify, classify, and describe attributes of different types of malware to effectively triage systems, implement countermeasures, and develop intelligence that can be shared with the community. Removing a rootkit can be vastly different than eradicating a virus, or quarantining a worm... in this case getting it right the first time can reduce the risk of a secondary outbreak...you wouldn’t want that now would you?

> Fun Fact: The term “in the wild” comes from an organization called “The WildList International” who maintain a list of malware that exists outside of malware research laboratories, also known as “zoos”. WildList International has been receiving reports from security researchers at antivirus and security companies since 1996. The current list is available here: http://www.wildlist.org/CurrentList.txt [1]

## TL;DR:

### Malware History:
-	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_computer_viruses_and_worms
-	http://malware.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_noteworthy_computer_malware

### Classifying Malware:
Advanced Malware Analysis describes malware taxonomy as <cite>"the process of classifying malware into different groups using a systematic approach based on its characteristics or attributes"</cite> [2].

#### Why classify malware?
- Malware analysis yields an understanding of a sample's purpose, directive, and primary function, organizing this data results in recognizable relationship patterns between groups
- Familiarity with these patterns allows you to identify a sample's class and predict its behavior
- New classes are created when a sample's characteristics/attributes don't fit into an existing class facilitating expansion of our understanding of malware [2]
- Speeds up analysis - allows you to an make educated guesses about your samples functionality based on its classification, then confirm your hypothesis [3]

#### What are classifications based on?
- Attributes - https://collaborate.mitre.org/ema/index.php/ema:Attributes
- Capabilities - https://collaborate.mitre.org/ema/index.php/ema:Capabilities
- Behaviors - https://collaborate.mitre.org/ema/index.php/ema:Behaviors

##### Examples:
- Operating system, or platform
- Infection vector
- Spreading mechanism
- Objective:
  - mass: infect as many systems as possible, most common, less sophisticated, detect/prevent with countermeasures
  - targeted: target an entity, less common, more sophisticated, circumvent countermeasures [3]
  
   ##### Notes:
     - Malware typically doesn't fall into just one category
     - Malware author's main concern when coding is directive
     - Most malware exhibits two or more behaviors, so you should tag samples with every class it belongs to [2]

#### Is there a standard for malware taxonomy?
The short answer, No. But, MITRE created <cite>"Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization (MAEC™) (pronounced “mike”) [which] is a community-developed structured language for encoding and sharing high-fidelity information about malware based upon attributes such as behaviors, artifacts, and relationships between malware samples" </cite> [4].

- Defines data types like boolean, dictionary, strings, etc. 
- Defines top-level objects like behavior, collection, malware action, family, and instance
- Defines relationship types
- Drovides a vocabulary specification
- Uses JSON
