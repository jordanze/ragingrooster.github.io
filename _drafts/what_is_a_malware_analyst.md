# Getting Started: What is Malware Analysis?
> "If I have seen further, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants" - Sir Isaac Newton

If you read my about page before checking out this blog post, then you know that I'm not one for reinventing the wheel. My intentions for this blog are twofold. First, I intend to use it to cement what I learn about malware analysis (they say if you write things down, you’re more likely to remember them) on my journey to becoming a reverse engineer and second to try and give back to the community. Because of my second goal, I feel that I need to be thorough, thus this first short post about what malware analysis is and who malware analysts are. I will try to keep this and subsequent posts in TL;DR format for you, so that I do the heavy lifting and you just get the meat and potatoes from the best sources available to me.

## TL;DR:

### What is a Malware Analyst?
Someone who examines malicious software to determine its functionality using specialized tools and methodologies. Successful malware analysts typically are:
Resourceful, Inquisitive, Problem Solvers, Independent, Self-aware, Quick learners, Critical thinkers

They also possess skills, or have knowledge of:
- Operating System Internals
- Network Protocols
- Scripting/Coding/Programming (Python, C, etc.)
- Reverse Engineering (debugging/dissembling)

It takes time and dedication to become a successful malware analyst.

### What is Malware Analysis?
The process of determining the capabilities and functionality of malicious software. This is achieved through static and behavioral analysis.

Basic static analysis: 
- Code is not executed. 
- Determine file properties and extract metadata
- Scan with anti-virus, or other automated tools
- Code is not reviewed

Advanced static analysis:
- Disassembly
- Code is reverse engineered

Basic behavioral (dynamic) analysis: 
- Code is executed
- Analyst interacts with sample in sandbox using specialized tools that monitor system changes

Advance behavioral analysis:
- Debugger
- Code is reverse engineered
